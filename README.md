# AccountManager
Account Manager is a JavaFX project designed to keep track of your bank account transactions, similar to a checkbook register. The app displays a list of all entered withdrawals and deposit and keeps your different account totals up to date. Using the app will allow you to keep track of your account totals even when checks you've written go uncashed for long periods of time. Data from the app is stored in a mySQL server.
