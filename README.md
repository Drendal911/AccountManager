# AccountManager
Account Manager is a JavaFX app designed to keep track of your bank account transactions. Similar to a checkbook register. The app displays a list of all entered withdrawals and deposit and keeps you different account totals up to date. Using the app will allow you to keep track of your account totals even when checks you've written go uncashed for long periods of time.
